# System

- [x] Mermaid -> After switching from D2 to mermaid, it loads indefinitely
- [x] D2 -> Loads indefinitely when graph is not x -> y. It cannot render anything else apparently
- [x] Fix D2 rendering, make its background match the apps (while maintaining png export logic)
- [x] Fix preview movement (zoom is broken)
- [x] Make preview / editor windows resizable -> Make them share a container, and allow resizing along their common edge
- [x] Fix the layout engines for mermaid, elk doesn't work

# UI

- [x] Ribbon menu doesn't take the whole width
- [x] App header too big, displays the name of the app for no reason and doesn't display close button


# Backlog (not ready to implement)

- [ ] export pdf ?
- [ ] Png saving (Implementation stubbed due to flutter_svg API issues in current version; requires further investigation/alternative approach)
