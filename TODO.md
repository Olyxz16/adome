# System

- [x] Mermaid -> After switching from D2 to mermaid, it loads indefinitely
- [x] D2 -> Loads indefinitely when graph is not x -> y. It cannot render anything else apparently
- [ ] Png saving (Implementation stubbed due to flutter_svg API issues in current version; requires further investigation/alternative approach)

# UI

- [x] Ribbon menu doesn't take the whole width
- [x] App header too big, displays the name of the app for no reason and doesn't display close button
